            "content": "The lives of around 25,000 villagers in Uttar Pradesh's Sitapur have been severely impacted by incessant flooding due to heavy rain in the past few days. The situation worsened on Monday after lakhs of cusecs of water were released from nearby barrages.\n\nFarmers have suffered significant losses, with crops, homes, and other properties destroyed across at least 80 villages, all affected by the swelling Saryu River.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs water submerged surrounding areas, Sitapur became virtually cut off, turning into an island. In about 30 villages, strong water currents made roads impassable, cutting off connectivity. In Angraura village, the water level was measured at over five feet.\n\nVast tracts of farmland have been submerged, destroying large amounts of crops.\n\nAs the water level continued to rise, particularly after the release from the barrages, villagers were evacuated to safer areas, some by boat and others on foot.\n\nThe worst-hit areas include Buchaupurwa, Dhodepurwa, Lodhanpurwa, Nageshwar Purwa, Pitambar Purwa, Baiju Purwa, Baxipurwa, Fatepurwa, Jagrooppurwa, Kewra, Akhari, Angraura, Mishranpurwa, Sotipurwa, Paramgonda, Shankarpurwa, Babakuti, Ataura, Kanarkhi, and Bagasti.\n\nWater has entered homes in more than 30 villages, while 50 villages remain marooned. Many schools have also been affected, and connectivity has been severed in numerous areas.\n\nIndia Today visited Niranjan Purwa and Angraura villages to observe the situation on the ground. According to 50-year-old Ram Lal, the damage has been severe due to the flooding of homes.\n\n\"We are being forced to leave our homes and seek higher ground. The situation is worsening, and we have no choice but to survive in the floodwaters,\" he said.\n\nBoats are now the only mode of transportation in these villages.\n\nFlood victims told India Today that their biggest problem is the lack of clean water for drinking, cooking, and daily use. They also claimed that relief materials and food packets have not reached them, as many remain trapped in the flood.\n\nA woman, who was forced to stay in a partially submerged house, said that the floodwater had completely destroyed her home and that the situation was deteriorating daily. She survived by cooking food on her terrace.\n\n\"Hundreds of bighas of paddy, sugarcane, mentha, and urad crops have been submerged. The situation is becoming alarming, with no sign of relief,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, opposition parties have criticised the Uttar Pradesh government for its inaction in addressing the dire situation, while the government claims that measures are being taken to manage the crisis.\n\nPublished By: Ajmal Published On: Sep 17, 2024"
